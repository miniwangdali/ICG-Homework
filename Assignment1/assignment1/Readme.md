# Instruction
This is the solution of assignment1. The solution is writen and built with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition in Windows 10 Pro 64-bit version 14393.187 (1607). So I do not have the instruction for Linux and Mac OS.

## Demand and Accomplishment
- [x] Render a rectangle as a pair of triangles textured with an image of your choice in two different positions on screen.
- [x] You must use the same buffers for both, but change the position using a shader uniform in the vertex shader.
- [x] **Bonus:** Add a uniform to the fragment shader and change the color or texture coordinate of the final pixel based on input.

## How to Run?
In this folder, you can see a folder called Release. Go into this folder and run the "assignment1.exe". Then it will show on your screen.

## How to Play?
It is a simple program that render a rectangle in two different position on the screen with the same buffer. Also, you could __CLICK and DRAG (HOLD & MOVE)__ your mouse to make the picture moving with your mouse. That is the point for Bonus in demand, which is finished by using a uniform based on input to change the texture coordinate.

## How to Compile?
I use Visual Studio to build this solution. So I did not write any makefile. So if you could use a Visual Studio 2015, it's easy for you to open this solution and build it by using the IDE.
